Bitswap (moved to `blockexchage` and `swap`)
============================================

> An implementation of the bitswap protocol in go!

Bitswap is the data trading module for ipfs. This module is deprecated and
only includes shims to facilitate transition to using the `swap/bitswap`,
`swap/httpswap` and `exchange/blockexchange` implementations.

See the [BlockExchange README](../exchange/blockexchange/README.md) for more
information.
