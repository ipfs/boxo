## Legend
The following emojis are used to highlight certain changes:
* ðŸ›  - BREAKING CHANGE.  Action is required if you use this functionality.
* âœ¨ - Noteworthy change to be aware of.

## [Unreleased]

- âœ¨ The gateway templates were updated to provide better features for users and gateway implementers:
  - New human-friendly error messages.
  - Updated, higher-definition icons in directory listings.
  - Customizable menu items next to "About IPFS" and "Install IPFS".
  - Valid DAG-CBOR and DAG-JSON blocks now provide a preview, where links can be followed.
- ðŸ›  In [`boxo/pinner`](./boxo/pinner), some listing methods have been changed to now return a `<-chan StreamedCid`.  This allows the consumption of pins *while* the pinner is listing them, which for large pinset can take a long time.
  The concerned methods are:
  - `DirectKeys`
  - `RecursiveKeys`
  - `InternalKeys`
- ðŸ›  Provider API refactor
  - `provider/queue` has been moved to `provider/internal/queue`.
  - `provider/batched.New` has been moved to `provider.New` and arguments has been changed:
    - a routing system is now passed with the `provider.Online` option, by default the system run in offline mode (push stuff onto the queue); and
    - you do not have to pass a queue anymore, you pass a `datastore.Datastore` exclusively.
  - `provider/simple` has been removed, now instead `provider.New` will accept non batched routing systems and use type assertion for the `ProvideMany` call, giving a single implementation.
  - `provider.NewOfflineProvider` has been renamed to `provider.NewNoopProvider` to show more clearly that is does nothing.
  - `provider.NewSystem` has been removed, `provider.New` now returns a `provider.System` directly.
  - `provider.Provider` and `provider.Reprovider` has been merged under one `provider.System`

### Changed

- Removed a mention of "bitswap" in blockservice debug logs
- Changed the Bitswap message package from "bitswap.message.pb" to "bitswap.message.v1.pb" to avoid protobuf panics due to duplicate registration with [go-bitswap](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap) (https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/pull/212)
- âœ¨ Remove a busyloop in blockservice getBlocks by removing batching when caching (https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/pull/232)

### Deprecated

None

### Removed

None

- Ensure dag-cbor/json codecs are registered in the gateway handler (https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/pull/223)
- âœ¨ Refactor the Gateway API to operate on higher level semantics (https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/pull/176)
- Fixed a panic in the gateway handler when returning errors (https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/pull/255)
